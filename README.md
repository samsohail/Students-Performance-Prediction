# Students-Performance-Prediction
This project uses Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting models to predict student performance in math, reading, and writing based on demographic features. The models were evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE), with Ridge Regression showing the best fit and accuracy in predictions.
